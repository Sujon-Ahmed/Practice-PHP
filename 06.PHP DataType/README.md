PHP Data Types
----------------
Variables can store data of different types, and different data types can do different things.
PHP supports the following data types:
1. String
2. Integer
3. Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
4. Boolean
5. Array
6. Object
7. NULL
8. Resource

PHP String
----------------
A string is a sequence of characters, like "Hello world!".
A string can be any text inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes

PHP Integer
---------------
An integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.
Rules for integers:
1. An integer must have at least one digit
2. An integer must not have a decimal point
3. An integer can be either positive or negative
4. Integers can be specified in: decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base 8), or binary (base 2) notation

PHP Float
-----------
A float (floating point number) is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form.
In the following example $x is a float. The PHP var_dump() function returns the data type and value:

PHP Boolean
----------------
A Boolean represents two possible states: TRUE or FALSE.

PHP Array
--------------
An array stores multiple values in one single variable.
In the following example $arr is an array. The PHP var_dump() function returns the data type and value:

PHP NULL
-----------
Null is a special data type which can have only one value: NULL.

A variable of data type NULL is a variable that has no value assigned to it.

<strong>Tip:</strong> If a variable is created without a value, it is automatically assigned a value of NULL.

Variables can also be emptied by setting the value to NULL:
