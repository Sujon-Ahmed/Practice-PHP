PHP Operators
-----------------
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

PHP divides the operators in the following groups:

01. Arithmetic operators
02. Assignment operators
03. Comparison operators
04. Increment/Decrement operators
05. Logical operators
06. Array operators
07. Conditional assignment operators

PHP Arithmetic Operators
------------------------------
The PHP arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common arithmetical operations, such as addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/), modulus(%), exponentiation(**) etc.

PHP Assignment Operators
-----------------------------
The PHP assignment operators are used with numeric values to write a value to a variable.

The basic assignment operator in PHP is "=". It means that the left operand gets set to the value of the assignment expression on the right.

Assignment          same-as
x = y   ,                x = y,
x = x + y     ,          x +=y
